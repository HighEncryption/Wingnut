# Wingnut

Wingnut is a [NUT](https://networkupstools.org/index.html) client for Windows. It provides a graphical interface 
for monitoring and managing a UPS (Uninteruptable Power Supply) that is controlled by NUT.

For those familiar with NUT, Wingnut is a replacement for upsmon. Wingnut does not manage the UPS device directly, 
but rather provides remote monitoring, notifications, and will shut down the local computer.
